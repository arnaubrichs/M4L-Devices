# M4L-Devices
Repository for my custom-made Max for Live Devices.

## Installation

Download the folder and drag and drop the .amxd files into your Ableton Live session. 

The folder contains the following devices, orgnanized by categories:

### Processing

- [HarmPercSeparation 1.0](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/7920/harmpercseparation): Performs harmonic/percussive separation using Flucoma's [HPSS algorithm](https://learn.flucoma.org/reference/hpss/)

### Dynamics

- Enveloper: Trigger an envelope manually, randomly, or using a MIDI input
- Beat Detector: Using Flucoma's [Onset detection](https://learn.flucoma.org/reference/onsetslice/) algorithm

### Panning

- MC Stereo Panner: Takes up to 32 channels in (using MC recievers), and pans them to a stereo field

### Utility

- [MultiMap Receiver 1.0](https://maxforlive.com/library/device/8060/multimap-receiver): Map any parameter in Live to anything sent from a global send object in Live or Max.
